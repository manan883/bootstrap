                          My experience with YardHouse was overall really positive. The food was high quality and served with good service. The multiple times I went, I had the pleasure to try the BBQ pizza, the meat lovers pizz      a and a bunch of appetizers such as the chicken nachos, and the boneless chicken wings. Happy Hour allows the cost of the meal to come down drastically which was a huge reason to keep coming back. Overall I love the yardhouse and would highly recommend it.

              <br><br>Service: Their service was slow during peak hours and they messed up my drink order which sucks however they did replace it without issue so that was good.

                          My favorite food there was the sweetella french toast which has an amazing flavor profile of sweet and tart. They also offer a great hot chocolate. Their service was good and we were to find our own seat wherever which is ironic because of the resturant name. The food took a while to get to us but it was worth it for the flavor. The price was expensive being around $50 for 2 people.

                         The BBQ chicken breast with a side of fries and a side of mac and cheese was the meal I tried. The chicken was really juicy and the mac and cheese was super creamy which gave the meal a complex texture profile. Their service was slow but this was during peak hours and their service was very transactional and felt cold. I loved their food and it was a place I would come back again once in a while. A 2 person meal came to around $40 which was kinda expensive but the fact that their were leftovers made it worth it.

                       Jitlada is one of the best hidden gems I have ever found. I found it by accident but their ambiance and food was the best. The chicken was one of the best chickens I have ever had, it was super juicy and fell apart like nothing. Mixed with the sauce and the carrots the texture and flavor profile was the best I have ever had. 2 person meal came to $40 but there were leftovers. Overall one of the best experiences I have ever had.
